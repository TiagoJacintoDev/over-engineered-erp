     - Infrastructure-Driven
     - Framework-Driven
   - Full Stack SSR
     - Monorepo
     - Framework based
     - Next.js w/ server actions

2. Separating the frontend from the backend
   - Frontend
     - React as a Framework
   - Backend
     - Transaction Script
   - Repository Distribution
     - PNPM Monorepo w/o shared code
